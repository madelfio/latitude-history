# latitude-history

*UPDATE*: No longer functional due to deprecation of Google Latitude and
the Latitude History API.  See the [location-calendar](https://github.com/madelfio/location-calendar)
project for a version that uses GPS tracks dumped from [Google Takeout](https://www.google.com/settings/takeout).

A project for viewing your location history in calendar format.
